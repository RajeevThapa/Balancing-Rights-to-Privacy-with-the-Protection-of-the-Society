\chapter{Use of Generative AI Tools} \label{cha: Generative AI}
While preparing this report we used generative AI tools to assist drafting and editing. We used the GPT-4 family of models for initial wording, rephrasing, and to suggest structural improvements. No analysis, original data generation, or automated fact checking by the model was relied upon without human verification. All AI-generated text was reviewed, revised, and validated by the authors. We verified every factual statement, checked each citation against primary sources, and corrected or removed any output that was inaccurate or unclear.
We did not upload confidential data, identifiable participant responses, or proprietary material to external AI services. The AI was not listed as an author and takes no responsibility for the work. The authors retain full responsibility for the content and integrity of the report.
For transparency we provide the following meta information.
Model: GPT-4 (OpenAI), used  September to December 2025.
Purpose: draft wording, improve narrative flow, and suggest structural edits.
Human review: all AI contributions were edited and validated by the authors.
Data safety: no personal data or confidential files were input to the AI.
